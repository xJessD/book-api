# Google Books API Search Engine

## Intro
[View it live here.]()
This is a project to create a search page using the Google Books API. Some of the tools used have been React, React Router Dom, and SCSS.

## MVP
### UI

✅ Header container introducing the page 

✅ Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

✅ A container of book card components

### Functionaltiy

✅ When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string

✅ The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.

✅ Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description

✅ The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes

✅ You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then


### Styling (required):

✅ You should separate DOM functions and non-DOM functions in different modules.

✅ Think about which containers/components are responsible for what. As a general rule of thumb, containers process/collect data and create components that render that data

✅ Always use iterators over loops

✅ Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

## Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):

✅ Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.

- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
